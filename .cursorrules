A TypeScript/Express/Prisma e-commerce API with production issues to investigate and resolve.

## Important Notes

## Code Standards

- Use TypeScript with strict mode
- Follow RESTful API conventions
- Use Prisma for database operations
- Imports at the top of files
- Use standard libraries and good coding patterns
